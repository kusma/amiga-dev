This directory contains the source code of the programs that call into
the Roadshow bsdsocket.library to configure the TCP/IP stack and to query
status information. These programs should compile out of the box, provided
you have the necessary SDK header files installed. I tried to keep all
the necessary files together, but it might not be the complete set.
Don't worry, though, the code is merely intended to be a demonstration
as to how to do what the configuration/query programs are doing.

This software is copyrighted, which means that you may create your own
programs using the techniques demonstrated in the source code, and
you may reuse parts of it, but you must not take this code as a whole
and claim it as your own.
