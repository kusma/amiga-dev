 * To: tcpdump-workers@tcpdump.org
 * Subject: [tcpdump-workers] request for LINKTYPE_
 *
 * We've had some discussion over on ethereal-dev about a "fake link" or
 * "raw SS7" dissector that allows dumping an arbitrary protocol into a
 * file without any (otherwise necessary) lower level protocols.  The
 * common example has been dumping MTP3 into a file without, well, MTP2 or
 * M2PA.
 *
 * We want to store these protocols directly in PCAP file format because
 * it's well defined and there isn't another (popular) file format for
 * capturing SS7 messages that we can reverse engineer (and we want to read
 * these files into Ethereal).  Rather than creating a new file format, it's
 * a lot easier to just allocate a LINKTYPE_.
 *
 * Here is the original post thread:
 *
 * http://ethereal.com/lists/ethereal-dev/200306/threads.html#00200
 *
 * July's thread on the subject:
 * 
 * http://ethereal.com/lists/ethereal-dev/200307/threads.html#00124
 *
 * August's thread:
 *
 * http://ethereal.com/lists/ethereal-dev/200308/threads.html#00193
 *
 *
 * and one of the last messages--which is why I'm mailing you today:
 * 
 * http://ethereal.com/lists/ethereal-dev/200308/msg00193.html
 *
 *
 * Based on the message in the last URL, I'd like to request a new
 * LINKTYPE_:  LINKTYPE_RAWSS7.
 *
 * This packets in this file type will contain a header:
 */

typedef struct _rawss7_hdr {
         /* NOTE: These are in network-byte order. */
         guint32 type;
         guint16 length;
	 guint16 spare;
} rawss7_hdr;

/*
 *
 * followed by protocol data for whatever protocol 'type' indicates.
 *
 * There was some discussion about these protocol 'type's being allocated by
 * tcpdump-workers as well.  In fact it would be handy to have one place to
 * allocate such numbers, so what do you think about allocating 3 more (for
 * now) LINKTYPE_'s:
 */

#define LINKTYPE_RAWSS7_MTP2	140
#define LINKTYPE_RAWSS7_MTP3	141
#define LINKTYPE_RAWSS7_SCCP	142

/*
 *
 *  There is no reason this can't be used to store non-SS7 protocols, but
 *  it's what we need to use it for now...
 *
