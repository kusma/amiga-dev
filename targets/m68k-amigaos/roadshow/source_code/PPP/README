This directory contains the source code of the sample programs that
go along with the Roadshow PPP drivers. Note that in this form they
represent prototypes and not 'the real thing'. This means in particular
that the experimental SANA-II extensions used both in the PPP drivers
and these programs may change in the future. After all, these changes
were only *suggested* and have not yet been adopted. Take care!

This software is copyrighted, which means that you may create your own
programs using the techniques demonstrated in the source code, and
you may reuse parts of it, but you must not take this code as a whole
and claim it as your own.
