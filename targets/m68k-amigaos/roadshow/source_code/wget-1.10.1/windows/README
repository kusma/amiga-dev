You can configure the Windows port of Wget by running configure.bat (in
the main Wget directory).  You can run it with no arguments to see the
list of possible options.  Run it with the option corresponding to the
compiler you intend to use to build Wget and follow the (brief)
instructions printed on the screen.  The instructions bellow are for
building Wget with Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC); you may need to make
appropriate substitutions for your compiler and build environment; 
currently wget can be built at least with Visual Studio/.Net, free 
Borland or Watcom compilers, and the free cygnus and mingw environments.

To build Wget with MSVC run configure.bat (in the main Wget directory)
with the argument --msvc, and then run nmake.  At a certain point in time
Wget exposed some compiler bugs in MSVC 5.0; later Wget started to 
expose (at least http.c, retr.c) some other compiler bugs in MSVC 6.0 
SP6 (cl.exe version 12) which could/can be worked around by compiling 
completely without optimization or at least partially (by using 
#pragma optimize("g",on) and "off" around offending functions).
However, read the rest of this document before continuing.

For MSVC the current default is to build Wget with SSL support.  For this
to work, you will need to have OpenSSL installed.  First, get OpenSSL
(http://www.openssl.org), compile it and install the relevant headers and
libraries where your compiler can find them; currently this could mean
(presuming default installation directories for MSVC 6.0) copy (from the
compiled OpenSSL directory) the whole inc32\openssl directory and its
contents to "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Include\openssl",
and from out32dll (in the OpenSSL directory) the two needed libraries
(libeay32.lib and ssleay32.lib) to
"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\lib".  These locations
aren't exactly the best but will get you started if you don't know where
to place these headers and libraries, you should find similar paths for 
later compiler versions. Usually at run-time some OpenSSL
libraries (currently ssleay32.dll and libeay32.dll) will need to be
available in your environment PATH.

If you don't want to/can't compile Wget with OpenSSL comment SSL related
lines in windows\Makefile.src; then follow the normal instructions
(configure.bat and so on).

If you want to build the help file you will need a copy of makeinfo to
convert wget.texi to rtf and html.  I've made a copy available at
<URL:ftp://sunsite.dk/projects/wget/makeinfo.zip>.  This copy of
makeinfo is from the miktxt 1.10 archive available from ctan.  You also
will need perl 5, one possibility is ActivePerl (currently free) from
<URL:http://www.activestate.com>; you need to locate the download and
install instructions for the current version available (since the
packages and installation instructions change from time to time).
