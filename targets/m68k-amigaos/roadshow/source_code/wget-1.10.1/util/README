This directory contains various optional utilities to help you use
Wget.


Socks:
======
Antonio Rosella <antonio.rosella@agip.it> has written a sample HTML
frontend and a Perl script to demonstrate usage of socksified Wget as
web retriever.

To configure Wget to use socks, do a
$ ./configure --with-sox.

download.html and download-netscape.html are examples of how you can
use socksified Wget to schedule the WWW requests.  wget.cgi is a
CGI Perl script used in conjunction with download.html, which
schedules request using the "at" command.

To get the script, contact Antonino.

rmold.pl
========
This Perl script is used to check which local files are no longer on
the remote server.  You can use it to get the list of files, or
$ rmold.pl [dir] | xargs rm
