Please note that Wget has more than one ChangeLog file:

    ./ChangeLog: documents changes to files in the top-level directory
                 and to files in subdirectories like po/ that don't have
                 their own ChangeLogs 

    src/ChangeLog: documents only changes to files in the src directory

    doc/ChangeLog: documents only changes to files in the doc directory

    windows/ChangeLog: documents only changes to files in the windows directory

When checking to see if a patch you sent in has been applied, please
look in the appropriate ChangeLog(s).
