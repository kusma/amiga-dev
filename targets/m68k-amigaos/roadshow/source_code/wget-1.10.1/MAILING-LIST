		      WGET-RELATED MAILING LISTS

There are several mailing lists related to GNU Wget, all of them
hosted by dotsrc.org, previously known as SunSITE.dk.

wget@sunsite.dk:

    The mailing list for users and developers.  This is the preferred
    place to post bug reports and suggestions, as well as discuss
    development-related matters.

    To post to the list, send mail to <wget@sunsite.dk>.  To
    subscribe, send mail to <wget-subscribe@sunsite.dk>.

    NOTE: The list allows posts from non-subscribers.  This is
    intentional; I hate having to subscribe to a list only to ask a
    single question.  However, to protect the list members from spam,
    non-subscribers must confirm messages they send to the list.

    If you're not subscribed to the list and ask something, don't
    forget to request that the responses be Cc'ed to you.

    The list is archived at:

	http://www.mail-archive.com/wget%40sunsite.dk/
        http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.wget.general

wget-patches@sunsite.dk:

    The mailing list for patch submission.  Please see the PATCHES
    file for a detailed description of how to send patches to this
    list.

    This is list is also open to non-subscribers, but it is *not* a
    discussion list.  It only ever distribute patches and immediate
    responses to a patch.  If you wish to take very active part in
    development, you might wish to subscribe to it anyway, and receive
    the new patches.  To do that, send mail to
    <wget-patches-subscribe@sunsite.dk>.

    The list is archived at:

        http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.wget.patches

As of this writing, the mail alias <bug-wget@gnu.org> is an alias for
<wget@sunsite.dk>.
